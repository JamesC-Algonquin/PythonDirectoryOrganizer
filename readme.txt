Welcome to the Python Directory Organizer!

This simple Python application sorts your files based on its file extension. For example, files with ".mp4" or ".avi" extensions will be placed in a folder called "Videos". 

Select the button next to the directory line to select a folder, or simply type it in yourself. Once you're sure you want to organize it, select the "Organize Directory" button to begin.

The "config.json" file can be edited in any text editor to customize your sorting needs. The "directory" value simply defines the name of the destination folder, and "extensions" is a list of the extensions you want associated with that folder. You can also add more folder and groups of extensions! Folders that don't exist are automatically created when the sorting script is executed.
Simply select the "Config" button in the app to open it in your default text editor.

If you accidentally mess up the configuration file, the program has a "Restore Defaults" option, which copies the "config_default.json" file over the "config.json" file. It's important not to edit that file.
